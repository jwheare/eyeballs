1. Copy eyeballs.js to your server
2. Put <div id="eyeballs"></div> in your HTML where you want the eyeballs to be
3. Put <script src="eyeballs.js"></script> at the end of your <body> to bring the eyeballs to life

Feel free to position and style div#eyeballs with CSS, but I'd advise leaving its box dimensions alone.
